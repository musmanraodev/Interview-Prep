##Primes##
Time Limit: 20 minutes  
Completion Target: 10 minutes  
###Exercise###
Given an integer, determine if the integer is prime.

Advanced:  
Given an integer, return the nth prime number.

Examples:  
`[0,2,1,3,5]` -> `[0,1,2,3,5]`  
`[5,4,3,2,1]` -> `[1,2,3,4,5]`  
`[1,2,3,4,5]` -> `[1,2,3,4,5]`  


Solutions:  
```python
x = 5
```

##Factorial##
Time Limit: 10 minutes  
Completion Target: 5 minutes  
###Exercise###
Given a number, return n! 

Examples:  
`5` -> 120
`10` -> 3628800


Solutions:  
```python
x = 5
```

##List Factors##
Time Limit: 20 minutes  
Completion Target: 10 minutes  
###Exercise###
Given a number, list it's prime factors

Advanced:  
Given 2 numbers, list the greatest common factor

Examples:  
 


Solutions:  
```python
x = 5
```

##Fibonacci##
###Exercise###
1. Fibonacci with recursion  
Given n, return a sequence of fibonacci numbers that is of length n. Solve this using recursion.
2. Fibonacci iteratively  
Given n, return a sequence of fibonacci numbers that is of length n. Solve this iteratively.
3. Fibonacci at scale  
Given n, return a sequence of fibonacci numbers that is of length n. Solve this, but so that subsequent calls to this function do not require recalculation.

Examples:  
`5` -> `[1,1,2,3,5]`
`15` -> `[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377]`

Solutions:  
```python
x = 5
```
